# eduview2

Welcome to my (@ftxrc) current project under my new data science experiment. 

### Requirements
1. MongoDB
2. Flask
3. Python 3+

### Installation
1. Install MongoDB or, if installed, `sudo service mongod start`
2. Use `mongoimport` to import the compiled data sets from raw_sets into their corresponding databases and tables
3. `python3 app.py`
4. Start coding

### Notice
This project is not production suitable material, and is highly unstable. Proceed with caution. It has not been properly packaged yet.

### To-do
1. Move raw_sets folder to pulsedata/tools repository and maintain it there
2. Make git submodules and make install routines for fetching and compiling/parsing standard data sets reducing time to download of repository and size
3. Other things I'm forgetting
